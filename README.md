# Canteen management System

### Features
* This app solves the time spent in the canteen lines in any college. This project is used to pre-order food and get email notification when the food is ready. This makes it easier for the students to order food while sitting in the class itself
* This also enables the canteen staff to update the food items on a daily basis
* This project also uses a balance system for students(Every student has limited prepaid amount in the balance using which they can buy food)
